## Betfair Automation

This repository establishes an automated process to place bets on Betfair using the Betfair API.

You can create an API Account from instructions here https://betfair-datascientists.github.io/api/apiPythontutorial/.

Once you have created an appkey you can embed the key, your username and password in a .env file in this project directory. An example of how a trade is executed and how we login is found in the trade_execution.py file. All helper functions are found in the Driver folder.
